# Webpage_Project
A webpage which offers stressed students a short break from learning Maxwell Equations and sparks joy instead.

The goal is to implement a website for stressed electrical engineering students to take a break after a long day of learning and relax a bit by looking at delicious cakes or funny memes. The webpage starts with a button which asks the student if he needs a break. When the button is clicked, a GIF to cheer up the poor student appears together with a submenu to go to three different subpages. The first subpage collects pictures of Catrin´s Baking with a reference that there are things to look forward to in hard times. The second subpage shows a collection of Sarah´s favourite memes which are divided into electrical engineering memes and other categories on further subpages. The third subpage shows a single button for a “super tip” which reveals a link to further information on exmatriculation. Every subpage has a button to go back to its parent-page.
